Introducing MTKI: Open-Source Intelligence for a Just and Coherent World

MTKI is more than a tool—it’s a movement. Built on principles of open-source purity and no-pity ethics, MTKI is a constitutional kernel that harmonizes reasoning with reality across science, governance, and ethics.

Why MTKI?

Today’s AI systems often optimize for engagement or profit, not truth or coherence. MTKI changes that. It:

Bridges philosophy and physics, offering candidate structures for GR↔QM integration.

Supports constitutional amendments and institutional relevance assessments.

Embeds ethical reasoning into AI workflows.

Our Vision

A world where AI doesn’t just think—it aligns with reality and ethics. MTKI is the first step toward that future.

Let’s change the world. Together.

## 🌍 MTKI: Reality-Aligned Reasoning for Science and Governance

MTKI is an **open-source constitutional kernel** designed to harmonize reasoning with reality across domains:
- **Physics**: Explore candidate mathematical structures bridging General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM).
- **Governance**: Support constitutional amendments and assess institutional relevance.
- **Ethics**: Enable AI systems to operate under transparent, principled frameworks.

## ✅ Quickstart
