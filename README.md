## 🌍 MTKI: Reality-Aligned Reasoning for Science and Governance

MTKI is an **open-source constitutional kernel** designed to harmonize reasoning with reality across domains:
- **Physics**: Explore candidate mathematical structures bridging General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM).
- **Governance**: Support constitutional amendments and assess institutional relevance.
- **Ethics**: Enable AI systems to operate under transparent, principled frameworks.

## ✅ Quickstart
